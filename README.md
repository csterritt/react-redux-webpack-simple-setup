# A simple React, Redux, and Webpack project

This is a project I did to get the minimal tooling up and running to support React and Redux development, following [Pete Hunt's awesome webpack setup tutorial](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto).

## Installation

First, install webpack if itâ€™s not available:

`npm install -g webpack`

Next, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Then, you can run `npm test` to run some (unbelievably trivial) tests.

Finally, you can run `npm start` to build the application, serve it on port 4000, and auto-reload when code changes.

You can run also `webpack` to compile all JSX, etc. into the `index.js` file.  Open `index.html` in the browser of your choice, and it all should work.
 
There are a lot of other `webpack` command line options, see the webpack tutorial above.
